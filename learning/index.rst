Here are the (mostly free) learning resources I find useful, with my short comments. I particularly love textbooks because it gives you the big picture of this subject (from table of contents), and how a specific topic is related to others (adjacent chapters the dependency of knowledges).

Some areas move extremely fast (e.g. machine learning frameworks) while others change fairly slowly (e.g. the good old MPI).

========================

Argon HPC training

LLNL HPC tutorial


Computing Systems
=================

Pure CS perspective. Not scientific computing components.

Machine Learning & Data Science

Atmospheric & Climate Science
=============================

I spend much more time on computing than with (although it's my undergrad major). 
Nevertheless. 

Also, scientific needs. Fast code is useless if it cannot solve major science. (Or business problems, in non-academia world.)
